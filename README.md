 Plaid is a software company that provides API's for application software to communicate with banks via language agnostic JSON. Some competitors are Stripe Connect, MX, Codat, Lightico, and Xignite. 

## How Plaid Uses Tech

Banks do not provide an API for their customer dtat because there is no financial incentive or regulatory requirements that they do so.
